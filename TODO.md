# TODO

* cockpit: frontal and side view of moon lander
* multiple rigid body (polyhedra) collisions
* contacts with friction
* XBox controller
* OpenGL bindings for rendering vertex array objects
* bump maps
* render articulated objects with configuration
* suspension using spring damper elements
* amend collision impulses for dynamics of linked bodies
* propagation of impulses during collision
* mass matrix
* better (faster) time of impact computation
* compiled sfsim.scm not being found
* decribe and render object using configuration
* 3D model: Dream Chaser, Soyuz, PTK NP, https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2565361
* LLVM-based structs
* 3d collision with object (points, lines, surfaces?)
* body with gears
* blog post: quaternions, rotational inertia, ground collision, springs, resting contacts
* softbody wheels
* collision mesh for vehicle
* tool to convert wavefront to fast loading binary format
* integrated OpenGL/3D model bindings
* LLVM bindings
* Guile array implementation of simulator
* 3D moon rendering
* 3D cockpit
* music player, mp3 player
* video communication with screen in 3D cockpit
* autopilot programs: baseland, helicopter, hover/autoland, launch/deorbit, aerocapture/aerobrake, airspeed hold, attitude hold, altitude hold, heading alignment cylinder, VOR/ILS, eject, capture, base sync, station sync, dock
* on board displays, cameras, MFDs
* no need to adjust MFDs during critical parts of the mission
* model with multiple moving parts (e.g. gear)
* https://github.com/HappyEnte/DreamChaser
* add license
* load two objects
* flip textures when loading
* load compressed textures
* resize hash dynamically
* use relative path when loading material and texture files
* make object name optional
* more parse error information, reset lexer and parser
* render to VAOs with one program (setup of vertex array pointers)
* read Wavefront data from file
* surface smoothing groups
* look at NASA 3D models
* create and load Blender model
* rename project and library
* bind more than one texture
* objects with kinematic chain
* shadows (mask color pipeline output)
* blinking beacon lights
* EF2000 like cockpit controls (quick access views)
* EF2000 like gear suspension
* HDR bloom (separable convolution)
* multisampling
* windows (blending, reflections), greyscale cameras, MFDs
* frame buffer objects for non-blocking data transfer
* skybox for nebulas
* point sprites for stars, atmospheric flicker using sprite arrays
* point light sources
* cloud erosion
* project on sphere
* view matrix, model matrix stack, light position
* good tessellation for planet spheres
* collision detection
* multiple rigid or flexible objects
* create windows using blending
* test shaders (colors, normals, displacement, elevation map)
* free floating object
* thrusters
* spring damper for ground forces
* proper lift/drag ratio for high Reynolds numbers
* 3d cockpit with good projections
* draw points, lines, triangle strips, mfd for reentry and orbital mechanics
* detailed onboard systems (e.g. airlock, life support, auxiliary power units)
* threads for rendering, simulation, and loading of data
* event-based radio (triggers as in Operation Flashpoint)
* missions and high scores
* inspiration from Orbiter 2016, Rigs of Rods
* atmospheric rendering, clouds, water, elevation maps, fractal micro textures and maps
