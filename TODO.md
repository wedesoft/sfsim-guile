# TODO

* gear physics
* OpenGL, 3DS
* quaternion, state vectors
* compute forces of zero-mass spring damper gears
* cockpit: frontal and side view of moon lander
* XBox controller
* OpenGL bindings for rendering 3DS vertex array objects
* good tessellation for planet spheres
* 3D cockpit
* 3D moon rendering
* bump maps
* render articulated objects with configuration
* suspension using spring damper elements
* mass matrix
* JIT compilation to speed it up
* compiled sfsim.scm not being found
* 3D model: Dream Chaser, Soyuz, PTK NP, https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2565361
* music player, mp3 player
* video communication with screen in 3D cockpit
* autopilot programs: baseland, helicopter, hover/autoland, launch/deorbit, aerocapture/aerobrake, airspeed hold, attitude hold, altitude hold, heading alignment cylinder, VOR/ILS, eject, capture, base sync, station sync, dock
* on board displays, cameras, MFDs
* no need to adjust MFDs during critical parts of the mission
* https://github.com/HappyEnte/DreamChaser
* shadows (mask color pipeline output)
* blinking beacon lights
* EF2000 like cockpit controls (quick access views)
* EF2000 like gear suspension
* HDR bloom (separable convolution)
* multisampling
* windows (blending, reflections), greyscale cameras, MFDs
* frame buffer objects for non-blocking data transfer
* skybox for nebulas
* point sprites for stars, atmospheric flicker using sprite arrays
* point light sources
* cloud erosion
* project on sphere
* view matrix, model matrix stack, light position
* multiple rigid or flexible objects
* create windows using blending
* thrusters
* proper lift/drag ratio for high Reynolds numbers
* draw points, lines, triangle strips, mfd for reentry and orbital mechanics
* detailed onboard systems (e.g. airlock, life support, auxiliary power units)
* threads for rendering, simulation, and loading of data
* event-based radio (triggers as in Operation Flashpoint)
* missions and high scores
* inspiration from Orbiter 2016
* atmospheric rendering, clouds, water, elevation maps, fractal micro textures and maps
